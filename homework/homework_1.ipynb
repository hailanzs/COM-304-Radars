    "In this lab assignment, we will implement a 3D mmWave Radar Imaging system. Before\n",
    "starting the lab, please review the class lectures. We provide the data for students to work\n",
    "on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab consists of several tasks. The students are provided with some skeleton code for\n",
    "loading the lab data in the correct format and plotting the output radar heatmaps/point\n",
    "clouds for each task. The Jupyter notebook holds all of the relevant code blocks you will need to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must submit the lab file where you include the code, figures, and answer\n",
    "the questions in each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the mmWave radar data is as follows. The radar used has 1 transmitter and 4 receivers which is laid out linearly on the x axis (the transmitters are placed directly to the side of the receivers).\n",
    "The radar data is collected by a 2D Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with a size of 80 by 369 at one-wavelength by quarter-wavelength (i.e. the total size of the scanning area is 0.38 cm by 0.35 cm at 77 GHz). The 2D antenna array\n",
    "is placed on the X-Z plane, as shown in Fig. 1. <i> NOTE: This is different than the coordinate system introduced in the lecture.</i> \n",
    "\n",
    "The mmWave radar has a center frequency of\n",
    "77 GHz and it transmits Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar waveform\n",
    "with 3.5991 GHz bandwidth (sweeps from 77 GHz with a slope of 70.295 MHz/us). \n",
    "The FMCW beat frequency signal (output of mixing reflected chirp with reference\n",
    "chirp) is sampled 512 times at a sampling rate of 10,000 ksps. Therefore, the input mmWave radar data is a 3D matrix\n",
    "with a of size 80 $\\times$ 369 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 512. The first dimension is the first dimension is\n",
    "horizontal (x axis) of the antenna array (in this case 80 steps by 4 receivers = 320), the second dimension is the vertical (z axis) of the\n",
    "antenna array (369 in this case), and the third dimension is the number of data samples we have (512). \n",
    "The index of each antenna element can also be found in Fig. 1. We provide the x-position of the TX antenna (ant_pos) and  the x and z positions of the RX antenna elements (x_ant_pos and z_ant_pos). Where the transmitter will have the same z-position as each of the four Rx's it transmits to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note on coding: You can change input/outputs from functions as you please as well as any plotting code, however, the final plotted image is what we will look at for grading. \n",
    "Additionally, we recommend that you \n",
    "comment your code to make it easier for partial credit to be awarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data and details are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nlwuhJWaXnyrXdVq2ced3E1wyYrFIIHH?usp=sharing.\n",
    "A subset of what the results might look like are shown in example_outputs.pdf, however, this is of different data and not necessarily all of the plots we expect. These examples are simply to show an example of what you might expect. \n",
